737,"U.S. Breaks Up Fake I.R.S. Phone Scam Operation -- 21 people sentenced for up to 20 yrs, 32 in India indicted",109,54905,914,"[Some good news](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/business/irs-phone-scams-jeff-sessions.html) for those who have experienced this scam or know people who have been duped by the same: 

&gt;With stiff sentences for 21 conspirators last week in the United States and a round of indictments in India, the Justice Department says it has broken up what appeared to be the nation’s first large-scale, multinational telephone fraud operation.

&gt;Over four years, more than 15,000 victims in the United States lost “hundreds of millions” of dollars to the sophisticated scam, and more than 50,000 individuals had their personal information misused, the department said Friday. The money was routed through call centers in India back to the ringleaders in eight states.

&gt;The fraudulent calls came suddenly and frequently while the scam was active from 2012 to 2016, according to court documents. A person posing as an Internal Revenue Service or immigration official was on the phone, threatening arrest, deportation or other penalties if the victims did not immediately pay their debts with prepaid cards or wire transfers.

&gt;In an announcement on Friday, the department said 21 people living in eight states — Illinois, Arizona, Florida, California, Alabama, New Jersey and Texas — were sentenced last week in Houston to prison for up to 20 years for their role in the scheme.

&gt;In addition, 32 contractors in India involving five call centers in Ahmedabad, a city in western India, have been indicted on wire fraud, money laundering and other conspiracy charges as part of the operation, the department said.

As always, remain vigilant about supposed IRS claims, and never accept or believe any calls from people purporting to be the IRS. The IRS never demands immediate payment (e.g. wire transfers or gift cards), or threatens to bring in the police, immigration officers or other law-enforcement. Communication always begins over snail mail. Hopefully these arrests will serve as a warning to others trying to prey on vulnerable populations.

We’re constantly in awe of what redditors can accomplish when they join forces, from raising money [for children’s hospitals](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/04/extra-life-kicks-off-november-4th/) to shutting down the “inevitable” SOPA/PIPA. Today, European redditors, along with other concerned EU netizens, helped do the impossible once more. Thanks to the ruckus they raised with their Members of the European Parliament, [the flawed EU Copyright Directive has been sent back to the drawing board](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17535874/eu-copyright-law-article-11-13-rejected-first-vote), ending (for now) the threats to subject all user uploads to automated content filtering, and require licensing fees for all links. 

There is no mistake that it was people power that made this happen. Before the vote, MEP Catherine Stihler of Scotland [noted](http://www.businessinsider.com/eu-parliament-rejects-sweeping-internet-copyright-reforms-2018-7) that she had received a petition signed by a million people against the changes. Other MEPs noted the deluge of calls and letters that they had received leading up to the vote. 

This outpouring of activism about what most people would have considered a dull procedural vote would not have been possible without the awareness and urgency (and, yes, [super-dank memes](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvny8v/some-genius-memers-are-creatively-fighting-the-eus-possible-meme-ban)) that members of the Reddit community raised, and we’d like to particularly congratulate r/Europe for leading the way. They hosted informative AMAs with [MEP Julia Reda](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/) and Europe’s leading [independent experts on copyright reform](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8ugrow/eu_copyright_ama_we_are_professors_lionel_bently/), they kept everyone up to date on vote progress and outcomes (check out [their tally of the July 5th vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8wblrj/mep_votes_on_the_eu_copyright_directive_by_name/) to see how your MEP voted), and they [used megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8q1mfc/on_the_eu_copyright_reform/) to keep us all in the loop about what was happening and how to help. 

# What’s Next?

This isn’t over yet. The really important thing about this vote is that it takes what would have been pushed through into law behind closed doors and opens it up to a more public debate process, where citizens have the ability to weigh in, share their views, and build a compromise that protects rightsholders without imperiling free expression. 

The next vote will likely be on 10 September, and the coming weeks are critical to ensuring that the MEPs charged with hammering out amendments and drafting that compromise hear from their constituents.
